        Virtual CFO Services by TON Business Performance Consulting
    </span>
    <p class="mt-3 mb-2 post-text">
        As your expert virtual CFO team, our experienced operational CFOs work with you to fine-tune your financial strategy to maximize shareholder value, accelerate growth, and achieve your growth & profit goals.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2 post-text">
        We have several experienced virtual CFOs with high-level experience in dozens of industries and you will be assigned the CFO who best fits your industry and project needs. Your vCFO will help you achieve your financial strategy and you will benefit from the experience of the entire CFO team’s expertise, insights, and relationships.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2 post-text">
        A vCFO is a remote CFO who provides high-level CFO services to your company. This is a great way for smaller businesses to access the experience and insights of a high-level CFO without the cost of a comparably experienced in-house CFO.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2 post-text">
        A vCFO is an extremely strategic hire for businesses of any size. It should be considered an investment, not a cost, as the right CFO will always provide a return on your investment in the way of improved profit margins and cash flow, faster and more sustainable growth, more effective and efficient operations, improved vendor contracts and relationships, efficient debt and equity funding, strategic relationships, and more.

            <h2>Profit Maximization</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Maximize your profits. Your vCFO will take a look at your cash flow, vendor contracts, compensation strategy, and more to ensure you’re getting as much from your products or services as possible. In most cases, changes to your resource or inventory management, vendor contracts, and how you utilize your existing cash can have huge benefits to your bottom line.

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Financial Forecasting</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Think of financial forecasting as a financial blueprint that advises purchasing, R&D, hiring, capital raises, sales structure, and more to lay out the best path to achieve your goals. Your vCFO will take intelligence from your business data, industry trends, projections, and business goals to design a month-by-month forecast of target and conservative projections that act as a guide to help you get from where you are now to where you want to go.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Staff Development</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Part of your vCFO’s role in the company is to help your internal team support your new elevated financial strategy. We will work with you to train internal staff to support the new financial strategy and future growth, and can even work with you to elevate the skills of a high-potential employee to take over the CFO role when we are gone or will help you find a CFO to take a permanent spot in the company later down the road.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Systems Optimization</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                If you’re not receiving on-time or accurate financial reporting, if your finances have been too complex to keep a pulse on your financial health, if you don’t have a good grasp of your cash flow, or if you need to take your finances from basic historical accounting to more advanced and timely financial data, your vCFO can help. We will work with you to design and implement the best financial systems, practices and reporting for your company.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Sustainable Growth</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Create more sustainable growth. Many companies are able to grow–and even grow quickly–but far fewer are able to sustain and support that growth through the long-term. We will help you fine-tune your systems & processes for better business intelligence then help forecast your growth and what that growth will mean in terms of needs such as staff, materials, equipment, and other resources.            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Debt Restructuring</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Your vCFO will review your cash flow and liquidity requirements and advise you on the optimal debt structure (consolidation Vs restructure) bearing in mind any covenants with lenders to be observed. We can work on your behalf to negotiate with creditors to consolidate debt, minimise interest costs, reduce monthly payments and vary other repayment terms.            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Cost Optimisation, Structure and Procedures </h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Create more sustainable growth. Many companies are able to grow–and even grow quickly–but far fewer are able to sustain and support that growth through the long-term. We will help you fine-tune your systems & processes for better business intelligence then help forecast your growth and what that growth will mean in terms of needs such as staff, materials, equipment, and other resources.            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Cash Flow Forecasting</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Cash flow forecasting is an essential priority for businesses of any size particularly during an economic downturn. Your vCFO will help you gather the required business data to make vital business decisions quickly and identify any opportunities from the Government/lenders for support. Your cash flow model will consider various scenarios (including furlough of staff, VAT deferral, prioritisation of vendor payments etc.) to help you understand the implications of the downturn for the business. Armed with the cash flow model, you will be able to agree realistic payment terms for all your credit lines.
