            <h2>About George Daniel</h2>
            <p class="mt-1 mb-1 post-text">
                George Daniel is a Ph.D. level trained International Economist with more than 20 years of experience in economic and financial consulting, academia and the private sector. His expertise is on the application of economic and financial models in the analysis of issues in Sustainable Development, International Trade, Industrial policy and Environment and Renewable energy policy. His present focus is on the analysis of the economic costs and benefits of the transition to a Green Economy. Since 2014 he has been working on the financial barriers and economic impact of energy efficiency and renewable energy policy in the GCC. This has given him an intimate familiarity with the issues facing the region, governments’ agendas and policy priorities as they transition from hydro-carbon based to more diversified economies.

            <p class="mt-1 mb-1 post-text">
                His approach to consulting draws on the multi-cultural and international perspective he has developed from years employed in the private sector as an Analyst and Research Director and in academia, making him an avid promoter of market-based solutions for economic growth; the central role in this process that is played by governments, non-state organisations and other institutions in establishing the right environment and incentives to promote solid, sustainable diversified and inclusive economic growth.
